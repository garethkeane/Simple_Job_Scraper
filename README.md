# Simple_Job_Scraper
Perl code for parsing a dump from a portfolio company jobs page

This example is from June Oven, they were a lever.co user - usage was to save webpage https://jobs.lever.co/junelife/ and parse with this script
It dumps out text to a subidrectory with job details, this then gets parsed in a second step
A shell script runs the whole thing
